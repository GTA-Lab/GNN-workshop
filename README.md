# Graph Neural Networks Workshop

Lecturer: **Mahmood Amintoosi**, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad [Computer Science Dept.](https://fumcs.github.io/)

This workshop is designed to guide you through the fundamental concepts of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their applications.

The workshop is divided into two main sections:

## 1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Grid-Structured Data

In the first part, you'll explore the principles of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and how they can be applied to grid-structured data, such as images. You'll gain a solid understanding of the inner workings of CNNs and how the learned filters can be interpreted as adaptive feature extractors. This foundational knowledge will serve as a bridge to the exploration of graph neural networks in the second part of the workshop.

## 2. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Their Applications

In the second part, you'll dive deep into the world of graph-structured data and learn how GNNs can be leveraged to solve a variety of tasks, including node classification, graph classification, and graph regression. You'll have the opportunity to implement GNN models using the PyTorch Geometric library and apply them to real-world datasets, such as citation networks and molecular structures. Additionally, you'll explore the Cluster GCN architecture, which offers an efficient approach to scaling graph neural networks to large-scale datasets.

By the end of this workshop, you'll be well-equipped to apply these powerful techniques to your own graph-based problems.
