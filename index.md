# Graph Neural Networks Workshop

This workshop is designed to guide you through the fundamental concepts of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their applications. The workshop is divided into two main sections. In the first part, you'll explore the principles of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and how they can be applied to grid-structured data, such as images. You'll gain a solid understanding of the inner workings of CNNs and how the learned filters can be interpreted as adaptive feature extractors. This foundational knowledge will serve as a bridge to the exploration of graph neural networks in the second part of the workshop. In the second part, you'll dive deep into the world of graph-structured data and learn how GNNs can be leveraged to solve a variety of tasks, including node classification, graph classification, and graph regression. You'll have the opportunity to implement GNN models using the PyTorch Geometric library and apply them to real-world datasets, such as citation networks and molecular structures. Additionally, you'll explore the Cluster GCN architecture, which offers an efficient approach to scaling graph neural networks to large-scale datasets. By the end of this workshop, you'll be well-equipped to apply these powerful techniques to your own graph-based problems.

## Part I: ANNs & CNNs in PyTorch

In [this part of workshop](https://fum-cs.github.io/neural-networks), we’ll delve into the fascinating world of Neural Networks and Deep Learning with Python and Pytorch, where machines learn, adapt, and make decisions based on data. Topics that are covered are optmization, neural networks basics, perceptron model, mulit-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and advanced topics such as autoencoders and generative adversarial networks.

## Part II: Graph Neural Networks in PyG

In [the second part](https://gta-lab.github.io/graph-neural-networks), you'll dive deep into the world of graph-structured data and learn how GNNs can be leveraged to solve a variety of tasks, including node classification, graph classification, and graph regression. You'll have the opportunity to implement GNN models using the PyTorch Geometric library and apply them to real-world datasets, such as citation networks and molecular structures.
